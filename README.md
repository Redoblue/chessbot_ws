This project is a DIY of Chinese Chess Robot, which uses UR5 and kinect2 as its hardware backbone. Based on ROS, I created some packages to adapt to a specific chess-playing scene. You can find all the packages including *data_acquisition* (for deep learning task), *camera_calibration* (based on easy handeye), *modern_driver* (a modification of `ur_modern_driver` with rg2 gripper added), *moveit_config*, *description* (modeling files) and *control* in the codes above. You should be aware of that this project is still in developping, it is not finished yet.
